                            Hi, I am Weng-Ying Chang<strong>(張文胤)</strong>. My friends also call me <strong>"Wing"</strong>. I just graduated from National Chiao Tung University in 2020.
                            I am interesting in various fields of Computer Science, and I want to have great development in these fields, espacially in the game-related field.
                            Unfortunately, I am going to do the military service after graduation. Furthurmore, the military service will be postponed during the coronavirus.
                            It is unknown that when I will recieve the service request.
                            Due to these reasons, I have a long peroid of leisure time. I will try to improve my knowledges by sovling questions on Leetcode,
                            and I also hope that I could find a chance to gain my experiences and look for a company that I can work in after finishing my military service.

                                    This course contains lots of abstract concepts. And it was hard to understand how to use this skill at that time,
                                    because scalibility and readability were too hard for a freshman.
                                    Fortunately, I participated in other project from another course and saw the code designed by a senior master.
                                    I could understand that why we should use C++ and use classes to design the structure for a little bit then.

                                    Additionally, one of the courses called "NetWork Programming" that provided some credits to use AWS Cloud Service to have our own server.
                                    That was a rare chance to pratice Linux System and Network Programming at the same time.

                                    Software testing teaches me how important the QAs are, and which method to choose during the developement.

                                    It also provides a basic concept of website design to let us simulate how the owner manipulated the DB by website instead of opening DB on back-end.

                                    In my third year of NCTU, I was keen on designing games on my own. Then I started to learn Unity by myself.
                                    Thanks to Internet resources, I could design a simple easy 2D game and start to learn how 3D games actually working.

                            This is my first project in Unity, it's also my first time to build project with C#. This platform game contains three types of monster including one Boss, which has six types of diffrent skills and some basic adventure elements.
                            This porject is builded with other two members, and I was responsible for all physic systems, including monster movements, skill collisions, and all attack detections.
                            After this project, I can also experience that how useful C#'s features are and how important data structures are.

                            It is a new challenge for me when I first tried to combine hardware devices with software programs. Although there is some tutorial on website, I still tried to trace every class I used in my program.

                            I builded a simple card game on unity and used this api to finded rivals on steam. Matching then together to test SteamNetwork.
